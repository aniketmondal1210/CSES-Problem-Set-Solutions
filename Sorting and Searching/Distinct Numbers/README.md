# Distinct Numbers

## Problem
You are given a list of `n` integers, and your task is to calculate the number of **distinct values** in the list.

---

## Input
- The first input line has an integer `n`: the number of values.  
- The second line has `n` integers `x₁, x₂, …, xₙ`.

---

## Output
- Print one integer: the number of distinct values.

---

## Constraints
- 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5  
- 1 ≤ xᵢ ≤ 10^9  
- Time Limit: **1.00 s**  
- Memory Limit: **512 MB**

---

## Example

### Input

5
2 3 2 2 3


### Output

2


---

## Explanation
The list is `[2, 3, 2, 2, 3]`.
